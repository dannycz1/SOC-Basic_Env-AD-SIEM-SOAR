# SOC-Basic_Env-AD-SIEM-SOAR
Cloud-based SOC environment, based on Active Directory, Splunk, WebHook &amp; Shuffle. We will create unauthorized access alerts and lock out users.

# Active Directory + Splunk + Shuffle (SOAR) Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of an Active Directory environment with detection of unauthorized logins using Splunk and automated response with Shuffle.  
The deployment was carried out in the cloud using Vultr and is designed as a practical project for a SOC Analyst portfolio.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Set up an AD environment in the cloud (Vultr).
- Integrate Splunk for log ingestion and alert creation.
- Automate response actions with Shuffle and Slack (SOAR).
- Provide practical evidence applicable to a SOC Analyst role.
