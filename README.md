# SOC-Basic_Env-AD-SIEM-SOAR
Cloud-based SOC environment, based on Active Directory, Splunk, WebHook &amp; Shuffle. We will create unauthorized access alerts and lock out users.

# Active Directory + Splunk + Shuffle (SOAR) Project

This project demonstrates the implementation of an Active Directory environment with detection of unauthorized logins using Splunk and automated response with Shuffle.  
The deployment was carried out in the cloud using Vultr and is designed as a practical project for a SOC Analyst portfolio.

## üéØ Objectives
- Configure a cloud-based Active Directory environment.
- Ingest Windows Security logs into Splunk and create a detection rule.
- Implement a SOAR playbook to respond to unauthorized successful logins.
- Document the process and provide evidence of practical skills applicable to SOC operations.
