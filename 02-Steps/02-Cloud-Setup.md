# Part 2 - Cloud Infrastructure Setup (Vultr)

## 🎯 Objective
Deploy the required virtual machines on Vultr to host the Active Directory server, Splunk SIEM, and Shuffle SOAR platform.

This step demonstrates **hands-on experience with cloud-based infrastructure deployment**, including firewall configuration and VM provisioning, relevant for SOC environments running in hybrid or cloud setups.

## 🛠️ Main Steps
1. Created the following virtual machines on Vultr:
   - Windows Server (for Active Directory).
   - Ubuntu Server (for Splunk SIEM).
2. Configured basic networking and firewall rules to allow necessary ports (RDP, SSH, Splunk, Shuffle).
3. Verified connectivity between the machines.

## 📷 Evidence
- Screenshot of Vultr dashboard showing deployed VMs.
- Example of firewall rules configured in Vultr.

## 🔗 Key Takeaways
- Understanding of basic cloud networking and VM provisioning.
- Ability to deploy SOC components in a cloud environment.

## ✅ Result
All required VMs are deployed and networked properly, ready for Active Directory and Splunk installation in the next step.
