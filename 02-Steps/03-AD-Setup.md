## 🎯 Objective
Install and configure Active Directory on Windows Server, promote it to a Domain Controller, and create user accounts and endpoints.

## 🛠️ Main Steps
1. Installed the Active Directory Domain Services role on Windows Server.
2. Promoted the server to Domain Controller.
3. Created test users and groups relevant to the SOC use case.
4. Joined a test machine to the domain.

## 📷 Evidence
- Screenshot of AD Users and Computers showing created accounts.
- Screenshot of the endpoint successfully joined to the domain.

## 🔗 Key Takeaways
- Hands-on experience managing AD environments.
- Understanding how user accounts and machines interact in a domain context.

## ✅ Result
A functional Active Directory domain with users and endpoints, serving as the data source for Splunk log ingestion in the next phase.
