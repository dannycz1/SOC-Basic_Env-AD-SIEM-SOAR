# Part 1 - Environment Diagram

## 🎯 Objective
Design the initial and final architecture diagrams to visualize the SOC environment before deployment.

This step demonstrates my ability to **plan and document infrastructure layouts**, a crucial skill for SOC analysts and security engineers who need to understand data flows and asset relationships.

## 📐 Tools Used
- draw.io (Diagrams.net) for architecture design.
- Icons representing servers, SIEM, SOAR, and endpoints.

## 🛠️ Main Steps
1. Designed the initial architecture including:
   - Active Directory (Windows Server).
   - Splunk SIEM on Ubuntu.
   - Shuffle (SOAR platform).
   - Slack integration for notifications.
2. Added network segments, log flows, and automation paths.

## 📷 Evidence
- Initial environment diagram (screenshot or PNG).
- Final architecture diagram after deployment (screenshot or PNG).

## 🔗 Key Takeaways
- Ability to visualize SOC environments before implementation.
- Understanding of log flow and integration points between AD, Splunk, and SOAR.

## ✅ Result
A clear and professional diagram outlining how all components will interact, serving as the foundation for the following implementation steps.
